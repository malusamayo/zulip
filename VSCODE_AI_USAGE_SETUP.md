# Tool Instructions  

1. In the **VS Code Marketplace**, install the extension **Copilot Interaction Archiver**: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Copilot-Archiver.copilot-archiver.

To ensure the archiver only runs on your homework assignments:

2. Remote SSH into your homework folder (**workspace**) in VS Code.
3. The extension will ask you to give **workspace access** whenever you open a new workspace.
4. Enable it **only for your homework projects** (so we don’t collect usage data for other Copilot use).

The extension requires authentication to securely upload your data.

- Enter your **Andrew ID** when prompted (we will only store the **hashed ID**), **or**
